/*!
A platform agnostic Rust friver for the [sx1509], based on the
[`embedded-hal`] traits.

## The Device

The [sx1509] is a GPIO expander that also providers LED driver
and keypad scanning functionality.  The device has two banks
of 8 GPIO pins.

## Supported features

At the time of writing, the support is very bare bones: you can
reset the device and configure basic GPIO functions by operating
on a bank at a time.

## Future

There's scope for some interesting API design choices; for example,
it would be nice to expose the individual GPIO pins as instances
that implement the GPIO traits from [`embedded-hal`] so that they
could in turn be used to interface with other drivers.

The keypad and LED driver functionality has some potential for
nice type safe API design by moving pins/banks into different
modes.

Care needs to be taken to find and ergnomic and zero cost
way to express these APIs.

For the moment we just have a fairly dumb pass through!

## Usage

Import this crate an an `embedded_hal` implementation:

```no_run
extern crate metro_m0 as hal;
extern crate sx1509;
```

Initialize the I2C bus (differs between the various hal implementations):

```no_run
let mut i2c = hal::I2CMaster3::new(
    &clocks,
    400.khz(),
    peripherals.SERCOM3,
    &mut peripherals.PM,
    &mut peripherals.GCLK,
    // Metro M0 express has I2C on pins PA22, PA23
    Sercom3Pad0::Pa22(pins.pa22.into_function_c(&mut pins.port)),
    Sercom3Pad1::Pa23(pins.pa23.into_function_c(&mut pins.port)),
);
```

and then instantiate the driver:

```no_run
let mut expander = sx1509::Sx1509::new(&mut i2c, sx1509::DEFAULT_ADDRESS);
expander.borrow(&mut i2c).software_reset()?;
expander.borrow(&mut i2c).set_bank_a_direction(0)?;
// read the pins from bank a
let pins = expander.borrow(&mut i2c).get_bank_a_data()?;
```

Note that you must `borrow` the i2c bus for the duration of each operation.
This allows the bus to be shared and used to address other devices in between
operations.

It is possible to take ownership of the bus for a longer period of time.  That
is required for `Future` based usage.  While `Future` based usage isn't supported
at this time, we do have support for this mode of operation:

```no_run
let mut owned = expander.take(i2c);

// Now you can borrow and perform the IO when you are ready:
let pins = owned.borrow().get_bank_a_data()?;

// and relinquish the bus when done
let (expander, i2c) = owned.release();
```
